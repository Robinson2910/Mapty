# Mapty

Overview:
The "mapty" website is designed to help users track and record their workout activities, such as running and cycling, and display them on an interactive map. The website provides a clean and modern interface for users to log their exercises and visualize their fitness progress.

Key Features:

Interactive Map: The website prominently features an interactive map powered by Leaflet, a popular JavaScript library for maps. Users can view and interact with markers representing their workout locations.

Workout Logging: Users can log their workouts by specifying the type (running or cycling), distance (in kilometers), duration (in minutes), cadence (step per minute), and elevation gain (in meters). This information helps users track their fitness achievements.

Form Toggle: The website includes a form that allows users to input workout details. The form can be toggled on and off, maintaining a clean and uncluttered design.

Workout History: Although currently commented out in the HTML code, the website is designed to display a history of logged workouts. Each entry includes details such as type, date, distance, duration, speed, and elevation gain.

Fonts and Styling: The website uses the "Manrope" font from Google Fonts and includes an external CSS file ("style.css") for custom styling, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent user experience.
